Simple project to get text previews using data set values. If the browser supports Mutation Observer the dataset keys stay reactive. There is certainly better ways to implement reactivity with a object based two-way data storage like in React or Vue instead of distributed datasets, but it is a demo on getting feedback direct in the IDE and using the additional HTML-attributes panel provided by Hype.

Usage: After registering the dataset keys with `HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass` for example `HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('headline');` every element below an element that has a `data-headline` and has the class `.headline` inside will have the content defined under `data-headline`.


Notes for version 1.1
---

**Example:** You mapped `data-user` with `HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('user');` in your Head HTML. Whenever you assign `data-user` on a group or symbol all children withat have the CSS class `.user` will be updated. If you are doing this assignment in the IDE it will be set by Hype on every scene load. To avoid that just set `.user-initial` instead.

**Explanation of initial-clause:** All values set with the attribute panel in Hype are persistent duo to the Hype runtime refreshing them on each scene load.  This little "genie" at work might be what people expect using the IDE but it certainly isn't how programmers updating values per script would expect things to behave. Hype DataDecorator 1.1 now has a baked in workaround for thisâ€¦ just add "-initial" to your attribute entry (for example `data-user-initial` given your key is normally `data-user`). Then this value will only be set as an initial value and honor updates done via script like `yourElement.dataset.user = "Max Musterman";` across scene transition. They are anyway honored in a scene context either way.

**Regular usage:**
```
HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('label'});
```
Now every `data-label` value update reflects in groups and symbols on each element with the class `.label`.

Notes for version 1.2.4
---
<sup>Switched to semantic versioning.</sup>  
**Usage with callback and refactored interface:**  
```javascript 
// map based on class hence data-headline --> .headline with default innerHTML callback
HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('headline');

// map based on class hence data-bgcolor --> .bgcolor with custom callback
HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('bgcolor', function(elm, value){
	elm.style.backgroundColor = value;
});

// map based on more complex selector with custom currency callback
HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToSelector('price', '.currency.formatted', function(elm, value){
	elm.innerHTML = new Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE', { style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR' }).format(value); 
});

// preset based overrides with hypeDocument callback
HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('preset', function(elm, value){
	switch (value){
		case "invalid":
			elm.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
			elm.style.color = 'yellow';
			elm.innerHTML = 'Broken!';
			//...
			break;

		case "valid":
			elm.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
			elm.style.color = 'white';
			elm.innerHTML = 'Fixed';
			//...
			break;

	}
});

// callback with hypeDocument and symbolInstance
HypeDataDecorator.mapDatasetToClass('symbol-start', function(elm, value, hypeDocument, symbolInstance){
	if(symbolInstance) {
		symbolInstance.startTimelineNamed(value, hypeDocument.kDirectionForward);
		console.log("was here in document "+hypeDocument.documentId());
	}
});
```

Default callback still only replaces the content in a save way (meaning if its and end node).
